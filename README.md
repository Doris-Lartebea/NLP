#METHODOLOGY 

1. Data Collection: Collect dataset of social media posts related to online shopping.

2. Preprocessing: Removing irrelevant or duplicate data, such as retweets, spam, or non-English language posts and tokenization, stemming, stop-word removal to prepare the text for analysis. Tokenization involves breaking down the text into individual words or phrases, stemming involves reducing words to their base form, and stop-word removal involves removing commonly used words like "the," "and" and "is."

3. Sentiment analysis: Conduct sentiment analysis on the preprocessed dataset using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify the emotional polarity of each post. Sentiment analysis involves classifying the polarity of the text as positive, negative, or neutral.

4. Emotion detection: Emotion detection involves classifying the emotional content of the text into categories such as joy, anger, sadness, disgust, disappointment etc. and use a natural language processing tool to analyze the emotional content of each post.

5. Visualization: Finally, we can visualize the results using graphs or charts to make the findings more accessible and understandable.
